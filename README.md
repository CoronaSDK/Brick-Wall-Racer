Brick-Wall-Racer
================

In the game cars will drive over a road but at the end of the road there is a roadblock. The objective of the game is to make sure that the cars brake before they reached the wall. When the user taps on the car, the car brakes. The game is over when 3 cars hit the roadblock.
